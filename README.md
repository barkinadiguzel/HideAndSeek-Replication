# HideAndSeek-Replication
HideAndSeek-Replication is a minimal PyTorch implementation of the Hide-and-Seek data augmentation method, focusing on translating the core idea into practice. It demonstrates how patch-level hiding during training encourages attention to multiple object regions without changing the model architecture or loss.
